* pdfOCRtext
This little [[http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/][tesseract]] and pdftoppm (part of the [[http://poppler.freedesktop.org/][Poppler library]]) wrapper simplifies extraction of text from PDF files using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
* Motivation
Sometimes old PDF files have such mangled text encodings that =pdftotext= cannot extract anything sane. OCR is often the only viable option in that case.
* Usage
Run just the command =pdfOCRtext= with no arguments to see the usage information.
You can try different intermediary image formats and DPI to get better results, but the default should work well enough.
* License
GPL-3+  and a very sincere request that you will use from now on
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
#+END_SRC
in you LaTeX documents from now on to have all those accented characters typeset correctly.
